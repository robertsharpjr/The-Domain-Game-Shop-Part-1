# The-Domain-Game-Shop-Part-1

## Project Description
We created an Entity Relationship model within the Microsoft Dataverse to provide backend support for The Domain Game Shop. The Domain Game shop is a sales application in which a user is guided through a sales life cycle offering a wide variety of computer parts and games. Using data and metadata, our tables generate one-to-many relationships and many-to-one relationships to effectively allow entities to communicate with each other. Our goal was to allow a user to start a shopping session, generate a cart, and select products from a store. Once the user has finalized their choices, then an order could either be canceled or created. If created, a formal invoice of the order details would be presented to the customer, along with the payment details.
